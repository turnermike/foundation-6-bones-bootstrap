`//Get AAM_Core_Subject. This object allows you to work with access control
//for current logged-in user or visitor
$user = AAM::getUser();

//Example 1. Get Post with ID 10 and check if current user has access to read it
//on the frontend side of the website. If true then access denied to read this post.
$user->getObject('post', 10)->has('frontend.read');

//Example 2. Get Admin Menu object and check if user has access to Media menu.
//If true then access denied to this menu
$user->getObject('menu')->has('upload.php');`
